$$ I/  Collecting data =============================
What subject is your data about? What is the source of your data?
	This is about Melbourne Housing Market,
	Source: https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market

Do authors of this data allow you to use like this? You can check the data license
	Should I hold off even longer in buying a two bedroom apartment in Northcote? 
		<-- This is the real reason for me in publishing this dataset :)

How did authors collect data?

		Address, Type of Real estate, Suburb, Method of Selling, Rooms, Price, Real Estate Agent, Date of Sale and distance from C.B.D.
